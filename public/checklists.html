                The most effective way to demonstrate
                GDPR compliance is to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA),
                article 35. Among other things, the DPIA must include the purpose of the processing,
                the types of data you process, who has access to it in the organization, any third parties
                (and their location) who have access, and how you plan to protect
                the data (such as encryption), and when you plan to erase it (if
                possible). The CSP should also provide your company with all
                this data access information. Therefore, the CSP should prepare
                its DPIA to keep track of all cloud accesses. This issue can be
                agreed upon when signing the SLA with the CSP. Your company
                will need to ask the CSP for their DPIA to complete their DPIA.

                The possible answers to this question relate
                to the legal basis for the processing defined by article 6. When
                the legal basis is “consent”, that is, the data subject (in your case,
                your customer) has given consent to data access, your company
                has additional obligations that include offering data subjects the
                opportunity to revoke this consent. In the case of processing for
                “legitimate interests” pursued by the others (your company, the
                CSP, or by a third party), article 6. f, an assessment of privacy impacts must be conducted by your
                company. There are other
                provisions in articles 7 to 11 related to children and special categories of personal data.

                This information should be included in your privacy policy and

                subjects must be informed about the data collected about them
                and why, according to article 12. You must report how the data

                It is important to consider that, according to GDPR,
                a data breach that exposes personal data must be reported to the
                supervisory authority within 72 hours. According to article 34, you must also
                notify the supervisory authority and your customers immediately,
                within 72 hours, if there is a data breach. Unless the breach is
                unlikely to put them at risk, for instance, if the data stolen is
                encrypted.

                For GDPR compliance, almost all services
                require a standard data processing agreement, which includes any
                third-party services that handle your data subjects’ personal information.
                A template for this agreement is available <a href="https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement/">here</a>
                , which must be visible on your
                website and specify the rights and obligations of each party. It is
                imperative to only work with third parties who can provide ade-
                quate data protection guarantees. Then, the SLA with the CSP
                must specify the list of permitted third parties.

                There are some circumstances in which or-
                ganizations are required to have a Data Protection Officer (DPO).
                These conditions usually arise when a company’s activity involves
                large-scale data processing or sensitive or special categories of data
                are processed, according to articles 9 and 10. A DPO should be
                an expert in data protection. This officer should have duties that
                include monitoring GDPR compliance, assessing data protection
                risks, advising on data protection impact assessments, and coop-
                erating with regulators. In any case, although having a DPO isn’t

                Your company should ask the CPS what metadata
                it collects and whether your company has a right to opt out.
                The CPS must guarantee that it will inform your company about
                this metadata, so this condition should also be included in the
                contract.

                Your company must sign an SLA with the
                CSP responsible for processing your customers’ data, acting as
                the joint controller, article 26. The SLA should identify the responsibilities of the SME and the CSP,
                as controller and joint controller, in a transparent manner. Particularly concerning the
                exercise of rights of the interested party and their respective responsibilities
                to provide the information referred to in articles 13
                and 14, the agreement may designate a point of contact for the
                interested parties.
                Furthermore, your company need to ensure that the hired CSP
                must declare adherence to the EU Cloud Code of Conduct (EU
                Cloud COC) about its cloud service, article 40. The EU Cloud
                COC was approved in 2021. It provides cloud-specific ap-
                proaches and recommendations, including a road map that tracks
                code requirements to GDPR and international standards like ISO
                27001 and 27018 . In addition, the CSP and the competent supervisory authority
                must certify that the cloud service fully complies with the provisions in the code.

                GDPR in the article 4 determines what is
                considered a breach in the collection, retention, and processing
                of data: “the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
                unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted,
                stored or otherwise processed”. Then, the company must specify
                the procedure it follows to notify when a breach is detected, for
                instance, in the event of theft or a leak. Before a breach is reported
                in the media, the CSP should inform your company, and your
                company should notify its customers and supervisory authorities.
                According to article 36, the controller must report any breach of
                personal data to the supervisory authority competent under article
                55 within 72 hours of becoming aware of it unless the breach is
                unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
                persons.
