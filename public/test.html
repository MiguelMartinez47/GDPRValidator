            The most effective way to demonstrate
            GDPR compliance is to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA),
            article 35. Among other things, the DPIA must include the purpose of the processing,
            the types of data you process, who has access to it in the organization, any third parties
            (and their location) who have access, and how you plan to protect
            the data (such as encryption), and when you plan to erase it (if
            possible). The CSP should also provide your company with all
            this data access information. Therefore, the CSP should prepare
            its DPIA to keep track of all cloud accesses. This issue can be
            agreed upon when signing the SLA with the CSP. Your company
            will need to ask the CSP for their DPIA to complete their DPIA.

            The possible answers to this question relate
            to the legal basis for the processing defined by article 6. When
            the legal basis is “consent”, that is, the data subject (in your case,
            your customer) has given consent to data access, your company
            has additional obligations that include offering data subjects the
            opportunity to revoke this consent. In the case of processing for
            “legitimate interests” pursued by the others (your company, the
            CSP, or by a third party), article 6. f, an assessment of privacy impacts must be conducted by your
            company. There are other
            provisions in articles 7 to 11 related to children and special categories of personal data.
