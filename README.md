# GDPRValidator web app project

This repository contains the source code of the web application GDPRValidator tool.

The installation and use of this tool from the sources present in this repo are very simple.
Users only need to download the .zip file and extract it into the desired folder. 
Once this is done, go into the '/public' folder and select the 'index.html' file, this will open it in your default browser, allowing you to use the tool locally.

However, if you don't want to download the source code of this tool, we will make it available via the web. 
This app is still under development, so the link to this web page is not yet established.
